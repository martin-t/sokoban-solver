- original-and-extra contains levels from both the original Sokoban by Thinking Rabbit and from XSokoban as collected [here](http://sokoban.dk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Thinking-Rabbit-Original-Plus-Extra.txt)

Other level sets are downloaded from http://www.sourcecode.se/sokoban/levels because they use a simple format:

- boxxle1 and boxxle2 and are by Thinking Rabbit

- 696 is by Dries De Clercq (the downloaded file was missing 15 and 557 so i added them from jsoko's collection)

- aymeric-cosmonotes, aymeric-cosmopoly (added 9,11,22), aymeric-microcosmos, aymeric-minicosmos, aymeric-nabocosmos, aymeric-picocosmos are by Aymeric du Peloux
  - http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=SolverStatistics-jsoko-AymericduPeloux mentions also "loma" but i couldn't find the whole set

- microban1 and microban2 are by David W. Skinner
