Sokoban solver
==============

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/martin-t/sokoban-solver/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/martin-t/sokoban-solver/commits/master)

So far can't do much, I am more playing with than language than trying to write a good solver.

Use `git config core.hooksPath git-hooks` to check fmt and clippy before commit.

Requires nightly (`rustup override add nightly`).
