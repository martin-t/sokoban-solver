Sokoban solver
==============

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/martin-t/sokoban-solver/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/martin-t/sokoban-solver/commits/master)

So far can't do much, I am more playing with the language than trying to write a good solver.

Use `git config core.hooksPath git-hooks` to check the code before committing.

Requires nightly (`rustup override add nightly`).

Everything except `levels/` is licenced under GPLv3 or later.
